 This is the commentary from the USA Today Sports Center, written by
IM Bjarke Kristiansen (and polished a bit by me).   They are probably
the quickest way to get the moves (perhaps AP access is quicker, I
don't know how fast the AP gets updated on Compuserve); their number
for subscribing (no online newuser service) is 800-826-9688.  I was told it was okay to post this from there, as long as I gave
appropriate reference.  WORLD CHESS CHAMPIONSHIP
GAME 13 - Drawn after Adjournment
November 24, 1990  KARPOV  KASPAROV 
  1.       d4      Nf6
  2.       c4       g6
  3.      Nc3       d5 Welcome to game 13th ..and the GI that's Grunfeld-Indian. Fight
from the start. 
  4.     cxd5     Nxd5
  5.       e4     Nxc3
  6.     bxc3      Bg7
  7.      Be3       c5
  8.      Qd2      O-O So far on two minutes each. GK.. Garry Kasparov looks tensed, says
Mike Valvo. Now Karpov took full 9 minutes to play ... 
  9.      Rc1      Qa5 Kasparov thought six minutes here. Time now: White 0:19 Black: 0:08.
Now 9 minutes has gone and AK is still thinks. Kasparov has left
the stage. Who is fooling who? 9..Qa5 might be a new move. Its
not in the pressroom database. Karpov is still thinking, so time for a
little presentation. At your service in Lyon IM Bjarke Kristensen (Now Valvo:
AK is nodding his head up and down alone on stage.) As kommentators:
Boris Spassky and a number of strong french IM's. IM Mike Valvo from New Jersey
is here for a week. 
 10.      Nf3       e6 And the 'soon-to-be' GM Will Watson from England is here too.
'I don't understand the GI' he just said. Kasparov stays on stage.
Time: White: 0:37 Black: 0:10. Says Will Watson (now WW): 'I
predicted the opening this morning. And so did many others.'
Valvo: 'I think this shows that the Kings Indian hasn't worked
out for Kasparov'. IM Levy suggests b7-b6 for Black. IM Jonathan Tisdall says:
I've seen this before. But nobody can find a game with it'. 
 11.       d5     exd5
 12.     exd5      Re8
 13.      Be2 Time: White: 0:53 Black: 0:24. Valvo observed GK tapping his
fingers impatiently on the table after move Re8. It just might all
be preparations! Both are sitting deeply concentrated at the table.       Bf5
 14.      O-O The atmosphere in the pressroom is a bit 'fuzzy'. The game hasn't
found it's own personality yet, and the fact that the US plays
the Soviets at the Chess Olympiad in Novi Sad at this very moment is
also widely discussed.       Nd7 Interesting is now: 15.Nh4 Be4 16.f3 Bxd5! 17.Qxd5 Rxe3 18.Qxd7
18...Rxe2 with a big Black plus. say Watson. Rumours say that
GK might be better here, but nobody really dares to risk his
neck. The game is still in its childhood. But AK surely is in for
a deep think. Now he's on 1:16 and still thinking. Garry has left the
stage. Valvo say: The Mephisto computer thinks Black is better!
It's no 'Deep Thought', but the Mephisto Chess Computer IS
already world champion in its class. No one else dared to test
their program against it! 
 15.       h3 Time: White: 1:18 Black: 0:31. Now Karpov has left stage. And GK
hangs over the board as if to power up his chessmuscles. Kasparov seems
relaxed and satisfied. White's problem is his weakened pawns on the Q-side.
And as for his pride-pawn on d5? In an endgame it could be pure
gold, but until then it gives a good square to a Black piece
on d6. Kasparov now 'hangs' his head between his hands. A very typical
posture for the WC.       Nb6 GM Lein thinks White is in deep trouble. GK might play Nb6-a4.
Another of GK's ideas might be Qa5-a4. 
 16.       g4 Now ...that's a man! Karpov's idea obviously is 16... Be4 17.c4 Qxd2
18.Nxd2 with 19.Nxe4 and 20.Bd3 to come. After a very slow start suddenly
the game is very exciting. Now the Russians GMs in the pressroom find:
16...Be4 17.c4.. Qa3! with a Black edge. But...       Bd7 Time: AK: 1:31  GK: 0:49. GM-elects Watson and Gallagher say Karpov is still

If Karpov plays Be3-c1 to press f2-f4 (hoping for an endgame

quite impotent. If advanced it'll just be lost, since Kg8 is to close. 
 27.      Rd1      Kf7 Time: White: 2:07 Black: 1:28. Now Kasparov's lead on the clock
begins to count. Karpov must be considering lines like: 28.d6 Ke6 29.Bf4
Be5 30.Bxe5 Kxe5 31.Rd5+ Ke6 32.d7 Rd8 and Black is much better. 
 28.      Rd3      Bf6

 30.      Rb3 Time: White: 2:12 Black: 1:31. It might look simple, but in fact
the game is balanced on an edge. Which is most important: Black's
weakness on b6 or White's on c4?       Bd8 People in the pressroom seems to be losing interest a bit. I think
that a long endgame battle may be ahead. The fight for the

 31.      Rc3 Both are leaning across the board. If Karpov can get his king to d3,
he might play on forever. Kasparov seems 'speculative' now.
One point in Karpov's favour is: 31...Bc7 32.Kf3 Re4 33.Ke2 f4
34.Kd3 and Re4 has to move.       Bc7 Karpov is hiding his head behind his hands, looking through his
fingers. Nine minutes left. 
 32.       a4      Kf6

GAME 13 - Drawn after Adjournment
November 24, 1990  KARPOV  KASPAROV 
  1.    d2-d4   Ng8-f6
  2.    c2-c4    g7-g6
  3.   Nb1-c3    d7-d5 Welcome to game 13th ..and the GI that's Grunfeld-Indian. Fight
from the start. 
  4.    c4xd5   Nf6xd5
  5.    e2-e4   Nd5xc3
  6.    b2xc3   Bf8-g7
  7.   Bc1-e3    c7-c5
  8.   Qd1-d2      O-O So far on two minutes each. GK.. Garry Kasparov looks tensed, says
Mike Valvo. Now Karpov took full 9 minutes to play ... 
  9.   Ra1-c1   Qd8-a5 Kasparov thought six minutes here. Time now: White 0:19 Black: 0:08.
Now 9 minutes has gone and AK is still thinks. Kasparov has left
the stage. Who is fooling who? 9..Qa5 might be a new move. Its
not in the pressroom database. Karpov is still thinking, so time for a
little presentation. At your service in Lyon IM Bjarke Kristensen (Now Valvo:
AK is nodding his head up and down alone on stage.) As kommentators:
Boris Spassky and a number of strong french IM's. IM Mike Valvo from New Jersey
is here for a week. 
 10.   Ng1-f3    e7-e6 And the 'soon-to-be' GM Will Watson from England is here too.
'I don't understand the GI' he just said. Kasparov stays on stage.
Time: White: 0:37 Black: 0:10. Says Will Watson (now WW): 'I
predicted the opening this morning. And so did many others.'
Valvo: 'I think this shows that the Kings Indian hasn't worked
out for Kasparov'. IM Levy suggests b7-b6 for Black. IM Jonathan Tisdall says:
I've seen this before. But nobody can find a game with it'. 
 11.    d4-d5    e6xd5
 12.    e4xd5   Rf8-e8
 13.   Bf1-e2 Time: White: 0:53 Black: 0:24. Valvo observed GK tapping his
fingers impatiently on the table after move Re8. It just might all
be preparations! Both are sitting deeply concentrated at the table.    Bc8-f5
 14.      O-O The atmosphere in the pressroom is a bit 'fuzzy'. The game hasn't
found it's own personality yet, and the fact that the US plays
the Soviets at the Chess Olympiad in Novi Sad at this very moment is
also widely discussed.    Nb8-d7 Interesting is now: 15.Nh4 Be4 16.f3 Bxd5! 17.Qxd5 Rxe3 18.Qxd7
18...Rxe2 with a big Black plus. say Watson. Rumours say that
GK might be better here, but nobody really dares to risk his
neck. The game is still in its childhood. But AK surely is in for
a deep think. Now he's on 1:16 and still thinking. Garry has left the
stage. Valvo say: The Mephisto computer thinks Black is better!
It's no 'Deep Thought', but the Mephisto Chess Computer IS
already world champion in its class. No one else dared to test
their program against it! 
 15.    h2-h3 Time: White: 1:18 Black: 0:31. Now Karpov has left stage. And GK
hangs over the board as if to power up his chessmuscles. Kasparov seems
relaxed and satisfied. White's problem is his weakened pawns on the Q-side.
And as for his pride-pawn on d5? In an endgame it could be pure
gold, but until then it gives a good square to a Black piece
on d6. Kasparov now 'hangs' his head between his hands. A very typical
posture for the WC.    Nd7-b6 GM Lein thinks White is in deep trouble. GK might play Nb6-a4.
Another of GK's ideas might be Qa5-a4. 
 16.    g2-g4 Now ...that's a man! Karpov's idea obviously is 16... Be4 17.c4 Qxd2
18.Nxd2 with 19.Nxe4 and 20.Bd3 to come. After a very slow start suddenly
the game is very exciting. Now the Russians GMs in the pressroom find:

 19.   Be2-f3   Na4-c3
 20.   Rc1xc3   Bg7xc3
 21.   Nd2-e4 The heat is on, in the Palais des Congress. Watson thinks GK is still

and it is a draw.    Re8xe4
 22.   Bf3xe4   Ra8-e8
 23.   Be4-d3    b7-b6
 24.   Kg1-g2 Tisdall says: The first one who can bring himself to offer a draw

 27.   Rf1-d1   Kg8-f7 Time: White: 2:07 Black: 1:28. Now Kasparov's lead on the clock
begins to count. Karpov must be considering lines like: 28.d6 Ke6 29.Bf4
Be5 30.Bxe5 Kxe5 31.Rd5+ Ke6 32.d7 Rd8 and Black is much better. 
 28.   Rd1-d3   Bc3-f6
 29.   Rd3-a3    a7-a5
 30.   Ra3-b3 Time: White: 2:12 Black: 1:31. It might look simple, but in fact
the game is balanced on an edge. Which is most important: Black's
weakness on b6 or White's on c4?    Bf6-d8 People in the pressroom seems to be losing interest a bit. I think
that a long endgame battle may be ahead. The fight for the
initiative is still very much on. Now Watson arrived with news,..
he said: The Russians think GK is slightly better, the Americans

 31.   Rb3-c3 Both are leaning across the board. If Karpov can get his king to d3,

 13.      Ge2 Time: White: 0:53 Black: 0:24. Valvo observed GK tapping his
fingers impatiently on the table after move Re8. It just might all
be preparations! Both are sitting deeply concentrated at the table.       Gf5
 14.      O-O The atmosphere in the pressroom is a bit 'fuzzy'. The game hasn't
found it's own personality yet, and the fact that the US plays
the Soviets at the Chess Olympiad in Novi Sad at this very moment is
also widely discussed.       Sd7 Interesting is now: 15.Nh4 Be4 16.f3 Bxd5! 17.Qxd5 Rxe3 18.Qxd7
18...Rxe2 with a big Black plus. say Watson. Rumours say that
GK might be better here, but nobody really dares to risk his
neck. The game is still in its childhood. But AK surely is in for
a deep think. Now he's on 1:16 and still thinking. Garry has left the
stage. Valvo say: The Mephisto computer thinks Black is better!
It's no 'Deep Thought', but the Mephisto Chess Computer IS
already world champion in its class. No one else dared to test
their program against it! 
 15.       h3 Time: White: 1:18 Black: 0:31. Now Karpov has left stage. And GK
hangs over the board as if to power up his chessmuscles. Kasparov seems
relaxed and satisfied. White's problem is his weakened pawns on the Q-side.
And as for his pride-pawn on d5? In an endgame it could be pure
gold, but until then it gives a good square to a Black piece
on d6. Kasparov now 'hangs' his head between his hands. A very typical
posture for the WC.       Sb6 GM Lein thinks White is in deep trouble. GK might play Nb6-a4.
Another of GK's ideas might be Qa5-a4. 
 16.       g4 Now ...that's a man! Karpov's idea obviously is 16... Be4 17.c4 Qxd2
18.Nxd2 with 19.Nxe4 and 20.Bd3 to come. After a very slow start suddenly
the game is very exciting. Now the Russians GMs in the pressroom find:
16...Be4 17.c4.. Qa3! with a Black edge. But...       Gd7 Time: AK: 1:31  GK: 0:49. GM-elects Watson and Gallagher say Karpov is still
under pressure, but improving. Mephisto 'thinks' it's slightly better for
Black. And the Russians say that Kasparov should have played h7-h5, not
Nd7-b6.

 19.      Gf3      Sc3

 21.      Se4 The heat is on, in the Palais des Congress. Watson thinks GK is still
doing well. Might be a British understatement. Kasparov is in for at deep
think. Time: White: 1:42 Black: 1:12 IM Tisdall: He'll take on e4 now,
and it is a draw.      Wxe4
 22.     Gxe4      We8
 23.      Gd3       b6
 24.      Kg2 Tisdall says: The first one who can bring himself to offer a draw
will get it. He might be right. A drastic change of the game has
taken place. And where did Kasparov drop his advantage? Maybe ...Nc3
should have been prepared. Time: White: 1:46 Black: 1:17.
If Karpov plays Be3-c1 to press f2-f4 (hoping for an endgame
advantage with f4-f5) GK might play Re8-e1 to enter a tame
dobble-bishop ending. Draw.        f5
 25.     gxf5     Gxf5
 26.     Gxf5     gxf5 Karpov sits thinking alone at the board. Black's Bc3 is potentially weaker
than Be3, but White's c4 pawn is GK's major target. I think that Black's
still better. White's d-pawn looks strong (and it is) but right now it's
quite impotent. If advanced it'll just be lost, since Kg8 is to close. 
 27.      Wd1      Kf7 Time: White: 2:07 Black: 1:28. Now Kasparov's lead on the clock
begins to count. Karpov must be considering lines like: 28.d6 Ke6 29.Bf4
Be5 30.Bxe5 Kxe5 31.Rd5+ Ke6 32.d7 Rd8 and Black is much better. 
 28.      Wd3      Gf6
 29.      Wa3       a5
 30.      Wb3 Time: White: 2:12 Black: 1:31. It might look simple, but in fact
the game is balanced on an edge. Which is most important: Black's
weakness on b6 or White's on c4?       Gd8 People in the pressroom seems to be losing interest a bit. I think
that a long endgame battle may be ahead. The fight for the
initiative is still very much on. Now Watson arrived with news,..
he said: The Russians think GK is slightly better, the Americans
thinks AK is slightly better and it might be a draw' says Watson. 
 31.      Wc3 Both are leaning across the board. If Karpov can get his king to d3,
he might play on forever. Kasparov seems 'speculative' now.
One point in Karpov's favour is: 31...Bc7 32.Kf3 Re4 33.Ke2 f4
34.Kd3 and Re4 has to move.       Gc7 Karpov is hiding his head behind his hands, looking through his
fingers. Nine minutes left. 
 32.       a4      Kf6
 33.      Kf1       f4 33...f4! GK played this with determination. I don't understand
Karpov's Kg2-f1. 
 34.      Gc1      Kf5
 35.      Wc2      Wg8
 36.      We2      Ge5

 38.     Gxd4     cxd4
 39.      We7       d3
 40.      Ke1      Wc8
 41.      Kd2     Wxc4 Kasparov has moved from c8 to c4. Move 41 made. The last seven
moves took only 11 minutes Now all analysis goes: 42.Kxd3
Rxa4 43.d6 Ra3+ 44.Kc4 Ra1 45. Kd5 Rd1+ 46.Kc6 a4 and White
might be the one who in trouble. Both still sits at the board. GK
is looking everywhere else, waiting for Karpov to decide on
if he want to sealed his move  now. Some say that Kasparov might
have proposed a draw earlier on. Not verified. Time: 2:42 - 2:08.
Karpov sealed his 42nd move. The game will be continued (maybe)
tomorrow at 11:00 AM ET.

should have been prepared. Time: White: 1:46 Black: 1:17.
If Karpov plays Be3-c1 to press f2-f4 (hoping for an endgame
advantage with f4-f5) GK might play Re8-e1 to enter a tame
dobble-bishop ending. Draw.        f5
 25.     gxf5     Bxf5
 26.     Bxf5     gxf5 Karpov sits thinking alone at the board. Black's Bc3 is potentially weaker
than Be3, but White's c4 pawn is GK's major target. I think that Black's
still better. White's d-pawn looks strong (and it is) but right now it's
quite impotent. If advanced it'll just be lost, since Kg8 is to close. 
 27.      Rd1      Kf7 Time: White: 2:07 Black: 1:28. Now Kasparov's lead on the clock
begins to count. Karpov must be considering lines like: 28.d6 Ke6 29.Bf4
Be5 30.Bxe5 Kxe5 31.Rd5+ Ke6 32.d7 Rd8 and Black is much better. 
 28.      Rd3      Bf6
 29.      Ra3       a5
 30.      Rb3 Time: White: 2:12 Black: 1:31. It might look simple, but in fact
the game is balanced on an edge. Which is most important: Black's
weakness on b6 or White's on c4?       Bd8 People in the pressroom seems to be losing interest a bit. I think
that a long endgame battle may be ahead. The fight for the
initiative is still very much on. Now Watson arrived with news,..
he said: The Russians think GK is slightly better, the Americans
thinks AK is slightly better and it might be a draw' says Watson. 
 31.      Rc3 Both are leaning across the board. If Karpov can get his king to d3,
he might play on forever. Kasparov seems 'speculative' now.
One point in Karpov's favour is: 31...Bc7 32.Kf3 Re4 33.Ke2 f4
34.Kd3 and Re4 has to move.       Bc7 Karpov is hiding his head behind his hands, looking through his
fingers. Nine minutes left. 
 32.       a4      Kf6
 33.      Kf1       f4 33...f4! GK played this with determination. I don't understand
Karpov's Kg2-f1.

 35.      Rc2      Rg8
 36.      Re2      Be5

 39.      Re7       d3
 40.      Ke1      Rc8
 41.      Kd2     Rxc4 Kasparov has moved from c8 to c4. Move 41 made. The last seven
moves took only 11 minutes Now all analysis goes: 42.Kxd3
Rxa4 43.d6 Ra3+ 44.Kc4 Ra1 45. Kd5 Rd1+ 46.Kc6 a4 and White
might be the one who in trouble. Both still sits at the board. GK
is looking everywhere else, waiting for Karpov to decide on
if he want to sealed his move  now. Some say that Kasparov might
have proposed a draw earlier on. Not verified. Time: 2:42 - 2:08.
Karpov sealed his 42nd move. The game will be continued (maybe)
tomorrow at 11:00 AM ET.

 So far on two minutes each. GK.. Garry Kasparov looks tensed, says
Mike Valvo. Now Karpov took full 9 minutes to play ...  Kasparov thought six minutes here. Time now: White 0:19 Black: 0:08.
Now 9 minutes has gone and AK is still thinks. Kasparov has left
the stage. Who is fooling who? 9..Qa5 might be a new move. Its
not in the pressroom database. Karpov is still thinking, so time for a
little presentation. At your service in Lyon IM Bjarke Kristensen (Now Valvo:
AK is nodding his head up and down alone on stage.) As kommentators:
Boris Spassky and a number of strong french IM's. IM Mike Valvo from New Jersey
is here for a week.  And the 'soon-to-be' GM Will Watson from England is here too.
'I don't understand the GI' he just said. Kasparov stays on stage.
Time: White: 0:37 Black: 0:10. Says Will Watson (now WW): 'I
predicted the opening this morning. And so did many others.'
Valvo: 'I think this shows that the Kings Indian hasn't worked
out for Kasparov'. IM Levy suggests b7-b6 for Black. IM Jonathan Tisdall says:
I've seen this before. But nobody can find a game with it'.  Time: White: 0:53 Black: 0:24. Valvo observed GK tapping his
fingers impatiently on the table after move Re8. It just might all
be preparations! Both are sitting deeply concentrated at the table.  The atmosphere in the pressroom is a bit 'fuzzy'. The game hasn't
found it's own personality yet, and the fact that the US plays
the Soviets at the Chess Olympiad in Novi Sad at this very moment is
also widely discussed.  Interesting is now: 15.Nh4 Be4 16.f3 Bxd5! 17.Qxd5 Rxe3 18.Qxd7
18...Rxe2 with a big Black plus. say Watson. Rumours say that
GK might be better here, but nobody really dares to risk his
neck. The game is still in its childhood. But AK surely is in for
a deep think. Now he's on 1:16 and still thinking. Garry has left the
stage. Valvo say: The Mephisto computer thinks Black is better!
It's no 'Deep Thought', but the Mephisto Chess Computer IS
already world champion in its class. No one else dared to test
their program against it!  Time: White: 1:18 Black: 0:31. Now Karpov has left stage. And GK
hangs over the board as if to power up his chessmuscles. Kasparov seems
relaxed and satisfied. White's problem is his weakened pawns on the Q-side.
And as for his pride-pawn on d5? In an endgame it could be pure
gold, but until then it gives a good square to a Black piece
on d6. Kasparov now 'hangs' his head between his hands. A very typical
posture for the WC.  GM Lein thinks White is in deep trouble. GK might play Nb6-a4.
Another of GK's ideas might be Qa5-a4.  Now ...that's a man! Karpov's idea obviously is 16... Be4 17.c4 Qxd2
18.Nxd2 with 19.Nxe4 and 20.Bd3 to come. After a very slow start suddenly
the game is very exciting. Now the Russians GMs in the pressroom find:
16...Be4 17.c4.. Qa3! with a Black edge. But...  Time: AK: 1:31  GK: 0:49. GM-elects Watson and Gallagher say Karpov is still
under pressure, but improving. Mephisto 'thinks' it's slightly better for
Black. And the Russians say that Kasparov should have played h7-h5, not
Nd7-b6.

 The heat is on, in the Palais des Congress. Watson thinks GK is still
doing well. Might be a British understatement. Kasparov is in for at deep
think. Time: White: 1:42 Black: 1:12 IM Tisdall: He'll take on e4 now,
and it is a draw.  Tisdall says: The first one who can bring himself to offer a draw
will get it. He might be right. A drastic change of the game has
taken place. And where did Kasparov drop his advantage? Maybe ...Nc3
should have been prepared. Time: White: 1:46 Black: 1:17.

advantage with f4-f5) GK might play Re8-e1 to enter a tame
dobble-bishop ending. Draw.        f5
 25.     gxf5     Bxf5
 26.     Bxf5     gxf5 Karpov sits thinking alone at the board. Black's Bc3 is potentially weaker
than Be3, but White's c4 pawn is GK's major target. I think that Black's
still better. White's d-pawn looks strong (and it is) but right now it's
quite impotent. If advanced it'll just be lost, since Kg8 is to close. 
 27.      Rd1      Kf7 Time: White: 2:07 Black: 1:28. Now Kasparov's lead on the clock
begins to count. Karpov must be considering lines like: 28.d6 Ke6 29.Bf4
Be5 30.Bxe5 Kxe5 31.Rd5+ Ke6 32.d7 Rd8 and Black is much better. 
 28.      Rd3      Bf6
 29.      Ra3       a5
 30.      Rb3 Time: White: 2:12 Black: 1:31. It might look simple, but in fact
the game is balanced on an edge. Which is most important: Black's
weakness on b6 or White's on c4?       Bd8 People in the pressroom seems to be losing interest a bit. I think
that a long endgame battle may be ahead. The fight for the
initiative is still very much on. Now Watson arrived with news,..
he said: The Russians think GK is slightly better, the Americans
thinks AK is slightly better and it might be a draw' says Watson. 
 31.      Rc3 Both are leaning across the board. If Karpov can get his king to d3,
he might play on forever. Kasparov seems 'speculative' now.
One point in Karpov's favour is: 31...Bc7 32.Kf3 Re4 33.Ke2 f4
34.Kd3 and Re4 has to move.       Bc7 Karpov is hiding his head behind his hands, looking through his
fingers. Nine minutes left. 
 32.       a4      Kf6
 33.      Kf1       f4 33...f4! GK played this with determination. I don't understand
Karpov's Kg2-f1. 
 34.      Bc1      Kf5
 35.      Rc2      Rg8
 36.      Re2      Be5
 37.      Bb2      Bd4
 38.     Bxd4     cxd4
 39.      Re7       d3
 40.      Ke1      Rc8
 41.      Kd2     Rxc4 Kasparov has moved from c8 to c4. Move 41 made. The last seven
moves took only 11 minutes Now all analysis goes: 42.Kxd3
Rxa4 43.d6 Ra3+ 44.Kc4 Ra1 45. Kd5 Rd1+ 46.Kc6 a4 and White
might be the one who in trouble. Both still sits at the board. GK
is looking everywhere else, waiting for Karpov to decide on
if he want to sealed his move  now. Some say that Kasparov might
have proposed a draw earlier on. Not verified. Time: 2:42 - 2:08.
Karpov sealed his 42nd move. The game will be continued (maybe)
tomorrow at 11:00 AM ET.

GAME 13 - Drawn after Adjournment
November 24, 1990 \endnochess  \nochess KARPOV  KASPAROV \endnochess \mn{1} d4 Nf6
\mn{2} c4 g6
\mn{3} Nc3 d5
 \nochess Welcome to game 13th ..and the GI that's Grunfeld-Indian. Fight
from the start. \endnochess \mn{4} c*d5 N*d5
\mn{5} e4 N*c3
\mn{6} b*c3 Bg7
\mn{7} Be3 c5
\mn{8} Qd2 O-O
 \nochess So far on two minutes each. GK.. Garry Kasparov looks tensed, says
Mike Valvo. Now Karpov took full 9 minutes to play ... \endnochess \mn{9} Rc1 Qa5
 \nochess Kasparov thought six minutes here. Time now: White 0:19 Black: 0:08.
Now 9 minutes has gone and AK is still thinks. Kasparov has left
the stage. Who is fooling who? 9..Qa5 might be a new move. Its
not in the pressroom database. Karpov is still thinking, so time for a
little presentation. At your service in Lyon IM Bjarke Kristensen (Now Valvo:
AK is nodding his head up and down alone on stage.) As kommentators:
Boris Spassky and a number of strong french IM's. IM Mike Valvo from New Jersey
is here for a week. \endnochess \mn{10} Nf3 e6
 \nochess And the 'soon-to-be' GM Will Watson from England is here too.
'I don't understand the GI' he just said. Kasparov stays on stage.
Time: White: 0:37 Black: 0:10. Says Will Watson (now WW): 'I
predicted the opening this morning. And so did many others.'
Valvo: 'I think this shows that the Kings Indian hasn't worked
out for Kasparov'. IM Levy suggests b7-b6 for Black. IM Jonathan Tisdall says:
I've seen this before. But nobody can find a game with it'. \endnochess \mn{11} d5 e*d5
\mn{12} e*d5 Re8
\mn{13} Be2 \nochess Time: White: 0:53 Black: 0:24. Valvo observed GK tapping his
fingers impatiently on the table after move Re8. It just might all
be preparations! Both are sitting deeply concentrated at the table. \endnochess  Bf5
\mn{14} O-O \nochess The atmosphere in the pressroom is a bit 'fuzzy'. The game hasn't
found it's own personality yet, and the fact that the US plays
the Soviets at the Chess Olympiad in Novi Sad at this very moment is
also widely discussed. \endnochess  Nd7
 \nochess Interesting is now: 15.Nh4 Be4 16.f3 Bxd5! 17.Qxd5 Rxe3 18.Qxd7
18...Rxe2 with a big Black plus. say Watson. Rumours say that
GK might be better here, but nobody really dares to risk his
neck. The game is still in its childhood. But AK surely is in for
a deep think. Now he's on 1:16 and still thinking. Garry has left the
stage. Valvo say: The Mephisto computer thinks Black is better!
It's no 'Deep Thought', but the Mephisto Chess Computer IS
already world champion in its class. No one else dared to test
their program against it! \endnochess \mn{15} h3 \nochess Time: White: 1:18 Black: 0:31. Now Karpov has left stage. And GK
hangs over the board as if to power up his chessmuscles. Kasparov seems
relaxed and satisfied. White's problem is his weakened pawns on the Q-side.
And as for his pride-pawn on d5? In an endgame it could be pure
gold, but until then it gives a good square to a Black piece
on d6. Kasparov now 'hangs' his head between his hands. A very typical
posture for the WC. \endnochess  Nb6
 \nochess GM Lein thinks White is in deep trouble. GK might play Nb6-a4.
Another of GK's ideas might be Qa5-a4. \endnochess \mn{16} g4 \nochess Now ...that's a man! Karpov's idea obviously is 16... Be4 17.c4 Qxd2
18.Nxd2 with 19.Nxe4 and 20.Bd3 to come. After a very slow start suddenly
the game is very exciting. Now the Russians GMs in the pressroom find:
16...Be4 17.c4.. Qa3! with a Black edge. But... \endnochess  Bd7
 \nochess Time: AK: 1:31  GK: 0:49. GM-elects Watson and Gallagher say Karpov is still
under pressure, but improving. Mephisto 'thinks' it's slightly better for
Black. And the Russians say that Kasparov should have played h7-h5, not
Nd7-b6. \endnochess \mn{17} c4 Q*d2
\mn{18} N*d2 Na4
\mn{19} Bf3 Nc3
\mn{20} R*c3 B*c3
\mn{21} Ne4 \nochess The heat is on, in the Palais des Congress. Watson thinks GK is still
doing well. Might be a British understatement. Kasparov is in for at deep
think. Time: White: 1:42 Black: 1:12 IM Tisdall: He'll take on e4 now,
and it is a draw. \endnochess  R*e4
\mn{22} B*e4 Re8
\mn{23} Bd3 b6
\mn{24} Kg2 \nochess Tisdall says: The first one who can bring himself to offer a draw
will get it. He might be right. A drastic change of the game has
taken place. And where did Kasparov drop his advantage? Maybe ...Nc3
should have been prepared. Time: White: 1:46 Black: 1:17.
If Karpov plays Be3-c1 to press f2-f4 (hoping for an endgame
advantage with f4-f5) GK might play Re8-e1 to enter a tame
dobble-bishop ending. Draw. \endnochess  f5
\mn{25} g*f5 B*f5

Be5 30.Bxe5 Kxe5 31.Rd5+ Ke6 32.d7 Rd8 and Black is much better. \endnochess \mn{28} Rd3 Bf6
\mn{29} Ra3 a5
\mn{30} Rb3 \nochess Time: White: 2:12 Black: 1:31. It might look simple, but in fact
the game is balanced on an edge. Which is most important: Black's

\mn{38} B*d4 c*d4
\mn{39} Re7 d3
\mn{40} Ke1 Rc8
\mn{41} Kd2 R*c4
 \nochess Kasparov has moved from c8 to c4. Move 41 made. The last seven
moves took only 11 minutes Now all analysis goes: 42.Kxd3
Rxa4 43.d6 Ra3+ 44.Kc4 Ra1 45. Kd5 Rd1+ 46.Kc6 a4 and White
might be the one who in trouble. Both still sits at the board. GK
is looking everywhere else, waiting for Karpov to decide on
if he want to sealed his move  now. Some say that Kasparov might
have proposed a draw earlier on. Not verified. Time: 2:42 - 2:08.
Karpov sealed his 42nd move. The game will be continued (maybe)
tomorrow at 11:00 AM ET.

GAME 13 - Drawn after Adjournment
November 24, 1990  KARPOV  KASPAROV 
  1.       d4      Nf6
  2.       c4       g6
  3.      Nc3       d5 Welcome to game 13th ..and the GI that's Grunfeld-Indian. Fight
from the start. 
  4.     cxd5     Nxd5
  5.       e4     Nxc3
  6.     bxc3      Bg7
  7.      Be3       c5
  8.      Qd2      O-O So far on two minutes each. GK.. Garry Kasparov looks tensed, says
Mike Valvo. Now Karpov took full 9 minutes to play ... 
  9.      Rc1      Qa5 Kasparov thought six minutes here. Time now: White 0:19 Black: 0:08.
Now 9 minutes has gone and AK is still thinks. Kasparov has left
the stage. Who is fooling who? 9..Qa5 might be a new move. Its
not in the pressroom database. Karpov is still thinking, so time for a
little presentation. At your service in Lyon IM Bjarke Kristensen (Now Valvo:
AK is nodding his head up and down alone on stage.) As kommentators:
Boris Spassky and a number of strong french IM's. IM Mike Valvo from New Jersey
is here for a week. 
 10.      Nf3       e6 And the 'soon-to-be' GM Will Watson from England is here too.
'I don't understand the GI' he just said. Kasparov stays on stage.
Time: White: 0:37 Black: 0:10. Says Will Watson (now WW): 'I
predicted the opening this morning. And so did many others.'
Valvo: 'I think this shows that the Kings Indian hasn't worked
out for Kasparov'. IM Levy suggests b7-b6 for Black. IM Jonathan Tisdall says:
I've seen this before. But nobody can find a game with it'. 
 11.       d5     exd5
 12.     exd5      Re8
 13.      Be2 Time: White: 0:53 Black: 0:24. Valvo observed GK tapping his
fingers impatiently on the table after move Re8. It just might all
be preparations! Both are sitting deeply concentrated at the table.       Bf5
 14.      O-O The atmosphere in the pressroom is a bit 'fuzzy'. The game hasn't
found it's own personality yet, and the fact that the US plays
the Soviets at the Chess Olympiad in Novi Sad at this very moment is
also widely discussed.       Nd7 Interesting is now: 15.Nh4 Be4 16.f3 Bxd5! 17.Qxd5 Rxe3 18.Qxd7
18...Rxe2 with a big Black plus. say Watson. Rumours say that
GK might be better here, but nobody really dares to risk his
neck. The game is still in its childhood. But AK surely is in for
a deep think. Now he's on 1:16 and still thinking. Garry has left the
stage. Valvo say: The Mephisto computer thinks Black is better!
It's no 'Deep Thought', but the Mephisto Chess Computer IS
already world champion in its class. No one else dared to test
their program against it! 
 15.       h3 Time: White: 1:18 Black: 0:31. Now Karpov has left stage. And GK
hangs over the board as if to power up his chessmuscles. Kasparov seems
relaxed and satisfied. White's problem is his weakened pawns on the Q-side.
And as for his pride-pawn on d5? In an endgame it could be pure
gold, but until then it gives a good square to a Black piece
on d6. Kasparov now 'hangs' his head between his hands. A very typical
posture for the WC.       Nb6 GM Lein thinks White is in deep trouble. GK might play Nb6-a4.
Another of GK's ideas might be Qa5-a4. 
 16.       g4 Now ...that's a man! Karpov's idea obviously is 16... Be4 17.c4 Qxd2
18.Nxd2 with 19.Nxe4 and 20.Bd3 to come. After a very slow start suddenly
the game is very exciting. Now the Russians GMs in the pressroom find:
16...Be4 17.c4.. Qa3! with a Black edge. But...       Bd7 Time: AK: 1:31  GK: 0:49. GM-elects Watson and Gallagher say Karpov is still
under pressure, but improving. Mephisto 'thinks' it's slightly better for
Black. And the Russians say that Kasparov should have played h7-h5, not
Nd7-b6. 
 17.       c4     Qxd2
 18.     Nxd2      Na4
 19.      Bf3      Nc3
 20.     Rxc3     Bxc3
 21.      Ne4 The heat is on, in the Palais des Congress. Watson thinks GK is still
doing well. Might be a British understatement. Kasparov is in for at deep
think. Time: White: 1:42 Black: 1:12 IM Tisdall: He'll take on e4 now,
and it is a draw.      Rxe4
 22.     Bxe4      Re8
 23.      Bd3       b6
 24.      Kg2 Tisdall says: The first one who can bring himself to offer a draw
will get it. He might be right. A drastic change of the game has
taken place. And where did Kasparov drop his advantage? Maybe ...Nc3
should have been prepared. Time: White: 1:46 Black: 1:17.
If Karpov plays Be3-c1 to press f2-f4 (hoping for an endgame
advantage with f4-f5) GK might play Re8-e1 to enter a tame
dobble-bishop ending. Draw.        f5
 25.     gxf5     Bxf5
 26.     Bxf5     gxf5 Karpov sits thinking alone at the board. Black's Bc3 is potentially weaker
than Be3, but White's c4 pawn is GK's major target. I think that Black's
still better. White's d-pawn looks strong (and it is) but right now it's
quite impotent. If advanced it'll just be lost, since Kg8 is to close. 
 27.      Rd1      Kf7 Time: White: 2:07 Black: 1:28. Now Kasparov's lead on the clock
begins to count. Karpov must be considering lines like: 28.d6 Ke6 29.Bf4
Be5 30.Bxe5 Kxe5 31.Rd5+ Ke6 32.d7 Rd8 and Black is much better. 
 28.      Rd3      Bf6
 29.      Ra3       a5
 30.      Rb3 Time: White: 2:12 Black: 1:31. It might look simple, but in fact
the game is balanced on an edge. Which is most important: Black's
weakness on b6 or White's on c4?       Bd8 People in the pressroom seems to be losing interest a bit. I think
that a long endgame battle may be ahead. The fight for the
initiative is still very much on. Now Watson arrived with news,..
he said: The Russians think GK is slightly better, the Americans
thinks AK is slightly better and it might be a draw' says Watson. 
 31.      Rc3 Both are leaning across the board. If Karpov can get his king to d3,
he might play on forever. Kasparov seems 'speculative' now.
One point in Karpov's favour is: 31...Bc7 32.Kf3 Re4 33.Ke2 f4
34.Kd3 and Re4 has to move.       Bc7 Karpov is hiding his head behind his hands, looking through his
fingers. Nine minutes left. 
 32.       a4      Kf6
 33.      Kf1       f4 33...f4! GK played this with determination. I don't understand
Karpov's Kg2-f1. 
 34.      Bc1      Kf5
 35.      Rc2      Rg8
 36.      Re2      Be5
 37.      Bb2      Bd4
 38.     Bxd4     cxd4
 39.      Re7       d3
 40.      Ke1      Rc8
 41.      Kd2     Rxc4 Kasparov has moved from c8 to c4. Move 41 made. The last seven
moves took only 11 minutes Now all analysis goes: 42.Kxd3
Rxa4 43.d6 Ra3+ 44.Kc4 Ra1 45. Kd5 Rd1+ 46.Kc6 a4 and White

on d6. Kasparov now 'hangs' his head between his hands. A very typical
posture for the WC.       Nb6 GM Lein thinks White is in deep trouble. GK might play Nb6-a4.
Another of GK's ideas might be Qa5-a4. 
 16.       g4 Now ...that's a man! Karpov's idea obviously is 16... Be4 17.c4 Qxd2
18.Nxd2 with 19.Nxe4 and 20.Bd3 to come. After a very slow start suddenly
the game is very exciting. Now the Russians GMs in the pressroom find:
16...Be4 17.c4.. Qa3! with a Black edge. But...       Bd7 Time: AK: 1:31  GK: 0:49. GM-elects Watson and Gallagher say Karpov is still
under pressure, but improving. Mephisto 'thinks' it's slightly better for
Black. And the Russians say that Kasparov should have played h7-h5, not
Nd7-b6. 
 17.       c4     Qxd2
 18.     Nxd2      Na4
 19.      Bf3      Nc3
 20.     Rxc3     Bxc3
 21.      Ne4 The heat is on, in the Palais des Congress. Watson thinks GK is still
doing well. Might be a British understatement. Kasparov is in for at deep
think. Time: White: 1:42 Black: 1:12 IM Tisdall: He'll take on e4 now,
and it is a draw.      Rxe4
 22.     Bxe4      Re8
 23.      Bd3       b6
 24.      Kg2 Tisdall says: The first one who can bring himself to offer a draw
will get it. He might be right. A drastic change of the game has
taken place. And where did Kasparov drop his advantage? Maybe ...Nc3
should have been prepared. Time: White: 1:46 Black: 1:17.
If Karpov plays Be3-c1 to press f2-f4 (hoping for an endgame
advantage with f4-f5) GK might play Re8-e1 to enter a tame
dobble-bishop ending. Draw.        f5
 25.     gxf5     Bxf5
 26.     Bxf5     gxf5 Karpov sits thinking alone at the board. Black's Bc3 is potentially weaker
than Be3, but White's c4 pawn is GK's major target. I think that Black's
still better. White's d-pawn looks strong (and it is) but right now it's
quite impotent. If advanced it'll just be lost, since Kg8 is to close. 
 27.      Rd1      Kf7 Time: White: 2:07 Black: 1:28. Now Kasparov's lead on the clock
begins to count. Karpov must be considering lines like: 28.d6 Ke6 29.Bf4
Be5 30.Bxe5 Kxe5 31.Rd5+ Ke6 32.d7 Rd8 and Black is much better. 
 28.      Rd3      Bf6
 29.      Ra3       a5
 30.      Rb3 Time: White: 2:12 Black: 1:31. It might look simple, but in fact
the game is balanced on an edge. Which is most important: Black's
weakness on b6 or White's on c4?       Bd8 People in the pressroom seems to be losing interest a bit. I think
that a long endgame battle may be ahead. The fight for the
initiative is still very much on. Now Watson arrived with news,..
he said: The Russians think GK is slightly better, the Americans
thinks AK is slightly better and it might be a draw' says Watson. 
 31.      Rc3 Both are leaning across the board. If Karpov can get his king to d3,
he might play on forever. Kasparov seems 'speculative' now.
One point in Karpov's favour is: 31...Bc7 32.Kf3 Re4 33.Ke2 f4
34.Kd3 and Re4 has to move.       Bc7 Karpov is hiding his head behind his hands, looking through his
fingers. Nine minutes left. 
 32.       a4      Kf6
 33.      Kf1       f4 33...f4! GK played this with determination. I don't understand
Karpov's Kg2-f1. 
 34.      Bc1      Kf5
 35.      Rc2      Rg8

 40.      Ke1      Rc8
 41.      Kd2     Rxc4 Kasparov has moved from c8 to c4. Move 41 made. The last seven
moves took only 11 minutes Now all analysis goes: 42.Kxd3
Rxa4 43.d6 Ra3+ 44.Kc4 Ra1 45. Kd5 Rd1+ 46.Kc6 a4 and White
might be the one who in trouble. Both still sits at the board. GK
is looking everywhere else, waiting for Karpov to decide on
if he want to sealed his move  now. Some say that Kasparov might

  2.       c4       g6
  3.      Nc3       d5 Welcome to game 13th ..and the GI that's Grunfeld-Indian. Fight

  7.      Be3       c5
  8.      Qd2      O-O So far on two minutes each. GK.. Garry Kasparov looks tensed, says
Mike Valvo. Now Karpov took full 9 minutes to play ... 
  9.      Rc1      Qa5 Kasparov thought six minutes here. Time now: White 0:19 Black: 0:08.
Now 9 minutes has gone and AK is still thinks. Kasparov has left
the stage. Who is fooling who? 9..Qa5 might be a new move. Its
not in the pressroom database. Karpov is still thinking, so time for a
little presentation. At your service in Lyon IM Bjarke Kristensen (Now Valvo:
AK is nodding his head up and down alone on stage.) As kommentators:
Boris Spassky and a number of strong french IM's. IM Mike Valvo from New Jersey
is here for a week. 
 10.      Nf3       e6 And the 'soon-to-be' GM Will Watson from England is here too.
'I don't understand the GI' he just said. Kasparov stays on stage.
Time: White: 0:37 Black: 0:10. Says Will Watson (now WW): 'I
predicted the opening this morning. And so did many others.'
Valvo: 'I think this shows that the Kings Indian hasn't worked
out for Kasparov'. IM Levy suggests b7-b6 for Black. IM Jonathan Tisdall says:
I've seen this before. But nobody can find a game with it'. 
 11.       d5     exd5
 12.     exd5      Re8
 13.      Be2 Time: White: 0:53 Black: 0:24. Valvo observed GK tapping his
fingers impatiently on the table after move Re8. It just might all
be preparations! Both are sitting deeply concentrated at the table.       Bf5
 14.      O-O The atmosphere in the pressroom is a bit 'fuzzy'. The game hasn't
found it's own personality yet, and the fact that the US plays
the Soviets at the Chess Olympiad in Novi Sad at this very moment is
also widely discussed.       Nd7 Interesting is now: 15.Nh4 Be4 16.f3 Bxd5! 17.Qxd5 Rxe3 18.Qxd7
18...Rxe2 with a big Black plus. say Watson. Rumours say that
GK might be better here, but nobody really dares to risk his
neck. The game is still in its childhood. But AK surely is in for
a deep think. Now he's on 1:16 and still thinking. Garry has left the
stage. Valvo say: The Mephisto computer thinks Black is better!
It's no 'Deep Thought', but the Mephisto Chess Computer IS
already world champion in its class. No one else dared to test
their program against it! 
 15.       h3 Time: White: 1:18 Black: 0:31. Now Karpov has left stage. And GK
hangs over the board as if to power up his chessmuscles. Kasparov seems
relaxed and satisfied. White's problem is his weakened pawns on the Q-side.
And as for his pride-pawn on d5? In an endgame it could be pure
gold, but until then it gives a good square to a Black piece
on d6. Kasparov now 'hangs' his head between his hands. A very typical

It's no 'Deep Thought', but the Mephisto Chess Computer IS

 15.       h3 Time: White: 1:18 Black: 0:31. Now Karpov has left stage. And GK

 26.     Fxf5     gxf5 Karpov sits thinking alone at the board. Black's Bc3 is potentially weaker
than Be3, but White's c4 pawn is GK's major target. I think that Black's
still better. White's d-pawn looks strong (and it is) but right now it's
quite impotent. If advanced it'll just be lost, since Kg8 is to close. 
 27.      Td1      Rf7 Time: White: 2:07 Black: 1:28. Now Kasparov's lead on the clock
begins to count. Karpov must be considering lines like: 28.d6 Ke6 29.Bf4
Be5 30.Bxe5 Kxe5 31.Rd5+ Ke6 32.d7 Rd8 and Black is much better.

 30.      Tb3 Time: White: 2:12 Black: 1:31. It might look simple, but in fact
the game is balanced on an edge. Which is most important: Black's
weakness on b6 or White's on c4?       Fd8 People in the pressroom seems to be losing interest a bit. I think
that a long endgame battle may be ahead. The fight for the
initiative is still very much on. Now Watson arrived with news,..
he said: The Russians think GK is slightly better, the Americans
thinks AK is slightly better and it might be a draw' says Watson. 
 31.      Tc3 Both are leaning across the board. If Karpov can get his king to d3,
he might play on forever. Kasparov seems 'speculative' now.
One point in Karpov's favour is: 31...Bc7 32.Kf3 Re4 33.Ke2 f4
34.Kd3 and Re4 has to move.       Fc7 Karpov is hiding his head behind his hands, looking through his
fingers. Nine minutes left. 
 32.       a4      Rf6
 33.      Rf1       f4 33...f4! GK played this with determination. I don't understand

 41.      Rd2     Txc4 Kasparov has moved from c8 to c4. Move 41 made. The last seven
moves took only 11 minutes Now all analysis goes: 42.Kxd3
Rxa4 43.d6 Ra3+ 44.Kc4 Ra1 45. Kd5 Rd1+ 46.Kc6 a4 and White
might be the one who in trouble. Both still sits at the board. GK
is looking everywhere else, waiting for Karpov to decide on
if he want to sealed his move  now. Some say that Kasparov might
have proposed a draw earlier on. Not verified. Time: 2:42 - 2:08.
Karpov sealed his 42nd move. The game will be continued (maybe)
tomorrow at 11:00 AM ET.

still better. White's d-pawn looks strong (and it is) but right now it's
quite impotent. If advanced it'll just be lost, since Kg8 is to close. 
 27.      Rd1      Kf7 Time: White: 2:07 Black: 1:28. Now Kasparov's lead on the clock
begins to count. Karpov must be considering lines like: 28.d6 Ke6 29.Bf4
Be5 30.Bxe5 Kxe5 31.Rd5+ Ke6 32.d7 Rd8 and Black is much better. 
 28.      Rd3      Bf6
 29.      Ra3       a5
 30.      Rb3 Time: White: 2:12 Black: 1:31. It might look simple, but in fact
the game is balanced on an edge. Which is most important: Black's
weakness on b6 or White's on c4?       Bd8 People in the pressroom seems to be losing interest a bit. I think
that a long endgame battle may be ahead. The fight for the
initiative is still very much on. Now Watson arrived with news,..
he said: The Russians think GK is slightly better, the Americans
thinks AK is slightly better and it might be a draw' says Watson. 
 31.      Rc3 Both are leaning across the board. If Karpov can get his king to d3,
he might play on forever. Kasparov seems 'speculative' now.
One point in Karpov's favour is: 31...Bc7 32.Kf3 Re4 33.Ke2 f4
34.Kd3 and Re4 has to move.       Bc7 Karpov is hiding his head behind his hands, looking through his
fingers. Nine minutes left. 
 32.       a4      Kf6
 33.      Kf1       f4 33...f4! GK played this with determination. I don't understand
Karpov's Kg2-f1. 
 34.      Bc1      Kf5
 35.      Rc2      Rg8
 36.      Re2      Be5
 37.      Bb2      Bd4
 38.     Bxd4     cxd4
 39.      Re7       d3
 40.      Ke1      Rc8
 41.      Kd2     Rxc4 Kasparov has moved from c8 to c4. Move 41 made. The last seven
moves took only 11 minutes Now all analysis goes: 42.Kxd3
Rxa4 43.d6 Ra3+ 44.Kc4 Ra1 45. Kd5 Rd1+ 46.Kc6 a4 and White
might be the one who in trouble. Both still sits at the board. GK
is looking everywhere else, waiting for Karpov to decide on
if he want to sealed his move  now. Some say that Kasparov might
have proposed a draw earlier on. Not verified. Time: 2:42 - 2:08.
Karpov sealed his 42nd move. The game will be continued (maybe)
tomorrow at 11:00 AM ET.

  8.      Qd2      O-O So far on two minutes each. GK.. Garry Kasparov looks tensed, says
Mike Valvo. Now Karpov took full 9 minutes to play ... 
  9.      Rc1      Qa5 Kasparov thought six minutes here. Time now: White 0:19 Black: 0:08.
Now 9 minutes has gone and AK is still thinks. Kasparov has left
the stage. Who is fooling who? 9..Qa5 might be a new move. Its
not in the pressroom database. Karpov is still thinking, so time for a
little presentation. At your service in Lyon IM Bjarke Kristensen (Now Valvo:
AK is nodding his head up and down alone on stage.) As kommentators:
Boris Spassky and a number of strong french IM's. IM Mike Valvo from New Jersey
is here for a week. 
 10.      Nf3       e6 And the 'soon-to-be' GM Will Watson from England is here too.
'I don't understand the GI' he just said. Kasparov stays on stage.
Time: White: 0:37 Black: 0:10. Says Will Watson (now WW): 'I
predicted the opening this morning. And so did many others.'
Valvo: 'I think this shows that the Kings Indian hasn't worked
out for Kasparov'. IM Levy suggests b7-b6 for Black. IM Jonathan Tisdall says:
I've seen this before. But nobody can find a game with it'. 
 11.       d5     exd5
 12.     exd5      Re8
 13.      Be2 Time: White: 0:53 Black: 0:24. Valvo observed GK tapping his
fingers impatiently on the table after move Re8. It just might all
be preparations! Both are sitting deeply concentrated at the table.       Bf5
 14.      O-O The atmosphere in the pressroom is a bit 'fuzzy'. The game hasn't
found it's own personality yet, and the fact that the US plays
the Soviets at the Chess Olympiad in Novi Sad at this very moment is
also widely discussed.       Nd7 Interesting is now: 15.Nh4 Be4 16.f3 Bxd5! 17.Qxd5 Rxe3 18.Qxd7
18...Rxe2 with a big Black plus. say Watson. Rumours say that
GK might be better here, but nobody really dares to risk his
neck. The game is still in its childhood. But AK surely is in for
a deep think. Now he's on 1:16 and still thinking. Garry has left the
stage. Valvo say: The Mephisto computer thinks Black is better!
It's no 'Deep Thought', but the Mephisto Chess Computer IS
already world champion in its class. No one else dared to test
their program against it! 
 15.       h3 Time: White: 1:18 Black: 0:31. Now Karpov has left stage. And GK
hangs over the board as if to power up his chessmuscles. Kasparov seems
relaxed and satisfied. White's problem is his weakened pawns on the Q-side.
And as for his pride-pawn on d5? In an endgame it could be pure
gold, but until then it gives a good square to a Black piece
on d6. Kasparov now 'hangs' his head between his hands. A very typical
posture for the WC.       Nb6 GM Lein thinks White is in deep trouble. GK might play Nb6-a4.
Another of GK's ideas might be Qa5-a4. 
 16.       g4 Now ...that's a man! Karpov's idea obviously is 16... Be4 17.c4 Qxd2
18.Nxd2 with 19.Nxe4 and 20.Bd3 to come. After a very slow start suddenly
the game is very exciting. Now the Russians GMs in the pressroom find:
16...Be4 17.c4.. Qa3! with a Black edge. But...       Bd7 Time: AK: 1:31  GK: 0:49. GM-elects Watson and Gallagher say Karpov is still
under pressure, but improving. Mephisto 'thinks' it's slightly better for
Black. And the Russians say that Kasparov should have played h7-h5, not
Nd7-b6. 
 17.       c4     Qxd2

 21.      Ne4 The heat is on, in the Palais des Congress. Watson thinks GK is still
doing well. Might be a British understatement. Kasparov is in for at deep
think. Time: White: 1:42 Black: 1:12 IM Tisdall: He'll take on e4 now,
and it is a draw.      Rxe4
 22.     Bxe4      Re8
 23.      Bd3       b6
 24.      Kg2 Tisdall says: The first one who can bring himself to offer a draw
will get it. He might be right. A drastic change of the game has
taken place. And where did Kasparov drop his advantage? Maybe ...Nc3
should have been prepared. Time: White: 1:46 Black: 1:17.
If Karpov plays Be3-c1 to press f2-f4 (hoping for an endgame
advantage with f4-f5) GK might play Re8-e1 to enter a tame
dobble-bishop ending. Draw.        f5
 25.     gxf5     Bxf5
 26.     Bxf5     gxf5 Karpov sits thinking alone at the board. Black's Bc3 is potentially weaker

 This is the commentary from the USA Today Sports Center, written by
IM Bjarke Kristiansen (and polished a bit by me).   They are probably
the quickest way to get the moves (perhaps AP access is quicker, I
don't know how fast the AP gets updated on Compuserve); their number
for subscribing (no online newuser service) is 800-826-9688.  I was told it was okay to post this from there, as long as I gave
appropriate reference.  WORLD CHESS CHAMPIONSHIP
GAME 13 - Drawn after Adjournment
November 24, 1990  KARPOV  KASPAROV 
  1.       d4      Nf6
  2.       c4       g6
  3.      Nc3       d5 Welcome to game 13th ..and the GI that's Grunfeld-Indian. Fight
from the start. 
  4.     cxd5     Nxd5
  5.       e4     Nxc3
  6.     bxc3      Bg7
  7.      Be3       c5
  8.      Qd2      O-O So far on two minutes each. GK.. Garry Kasparov looks tensed, says
Mike Valvo. Now Karpov took full 9 minutes to play ... 
  9.      Rc1      Qa5 Kasparov thought six minutes here. Time now: White 0:19 Black: 0:08.
Now 9 minutes has gone and AK is still thinks. Kasparov has left
the stage. Who is fooling who? 9..Qa5 might be a new move. Its
not in the pressroom database. Karpov is still thinking, so time for a
little presentation. At your service in Lyon IM Bjarke Kristensen (Now Valvo:
AK is nodding his head up and down alone on stage.) As kommentators:
Boris Spassky and a number of strong french IM's. IM Mike Valvo from New Jersey
is here for a week.

 13.      Be2 Time: White: 0:53 Black: 0:24. Valvo observed GK tapping his
fingers impatiently on the table after move Re8. It just might all

 14.      O-O The atmosphere in the pressroom is a bit 'fuzzy'. The game hasn't
found it's own personality yet, and the fact that the US plays
the Soviets at the Chess Olympiad in Novi Sad at this very moment is
also widely discussed.       Nd7 Interesting is now: 15.Nh4 Be4 16.f3 Bxd5! 17.Qxd5 Rxe3 18.Qxd7
18...Rxe2 with a big Black plus. say Watson. Rumours say that

stage. Valvo say: The Mephisto computer thinks Black is better!
It's no 'Deep Thought', but the Mephisto Chess Computer IS
already world champion in its class. No one else dared to test
their program against it! 
 15.       h3 Time: White: 1:18 Black: 0:31. Now Karpov has left stage. And GK
hangs over the board as if to power up his chessmuscles. Kasparov seems
relaxed and satisfied. White's problem is his weakened pawns on the Q-side.
And as for his pride-pawn on d5? In an endgame it could be pure

the game is very exciting. Now the Russians GMs in the pressroom find:
16...Be4 17.c4.. Qa3! with a Black edge. But...       Bd7 Time: AK: 1:31  GK: 0:49. GM-elects Watson and Gallagher say Karpov is still
under pressure, but improving. Mephisto 'thinks' it's slightly better for
Black. And the Russians say that Kasparov should have played h7-h5, not
Nd7-b6. 
 17.       c4     Qxd2
 18.     Nxd2      Na4
 19.      Bf3      Nc3
 20.     Rxc3     Bxc3
 21.      Ne4 The heat is on, in the Palais des Congress. Watson thinks GK is still
doing well. Might be a British understatement. Kasparov is in for at deep
think. Time: White: 1:42 Black: 1:12 IM Tisdall: He'll take on e4 now,
and it is a draw.      Rxe4
 22.     Bxe4      Re8
 23.      Bd3       b6
 24.      Kg2 Tisdall says: The first one who can bring himself to offer a draw
will get it. He might be right. A drastic change of the game has
taken place. And where did Kasparov drop his advantage? Maybe ...Nc3
should have been prepared. Time: White: 1:46 Black: 1:17.
If Karpov plays Be3-c1 to press f2-f4 (hoping for an endgame
advantage with f4-f5) GK might play Re8-e1 to enter a tame
dobble-bishop ending. Draw.        f5
 25.     gxf5     Bxf5
 26.     Bxf5     gxf5 Karpov sits thinking alone at the board. Black's Bc3 is potentially weaker
than Be3, but White's c4 pawn is GK's major target. I think that Black's
still better. White's d-pawn looks strong (and it is) but right now it's
quite impotent. If advanced it'll just be lost, since Kg8 is to close. 
 27.      Rd1      Kf7 Time: White: 2:07 Black: 1:28. Now Kasparov's lead on the clock
begins to count. Karpov must be considering lines like: 28.d6 Ke6 29.Bf4
Be5 30.Bxe5 Kxe5 31.Rd5+ Ke6 32.d7 Rd8 and Black is much better. 
 28.      Rd3      Bf6
 29.      Ra3       a5
 30.      Rb3 Time: White: 2:12 Black: 1:31. It might look simple, but in fact
the game is balanced on an edge. Which is most important: Black's
weakness on b6 or White's on c4?       Bd8 People in the pressroom seems to be losing interest a bit. I think
that a long endgame battle may be ahead. The fight for the
initiative is still very much on. Now Watson arrived with news,..
he said: The Russians think GK is slightly better, the Americans
thinks AK is slightly better and it might be a draw' says Watson. 
 31.      Rc3 Both are leaning across the board. If Karpov can get his king to d3,
he might play on forever. Kasparov seems 'speculative' now.
One point in Karpov's favour is: 31...Bc7 32.Kf3 Re4 33.Ke2 f4
34.Kd3 and Re4 has to move.       Bc7 Karpov is hiding his head behind his hands, looking through his
fingers. Nine minutes left. 
 32.       a4      Kf6
 33.      Kf1       f4 33...f4! GK played this with determination. I don't understand
Karpov's Kg2-f1. 
 34.      Bc1      Kf5
 35.      Rc2      Rg8
 36.      Re2      Be5
 37.      Bb2      Bd4
 38.     Bxd4     cxd4
 39.      Re7       d3
 40.      Ke1      Rc8
 41.      Kd2     Rxc4 Kasparov has moved from c8 to c4. Move 41 made. The last seven
moves took only 11 minutes Now all analysis goes: 42.Kxd3
Rxa4 43.d6 Ra3+ 44.Kc4 Ra1 45. Kd5 Rd1+ 46.Kc6 a4 and White
might be the one who in trouble. Both still sits at the board. GK
is looking everywhere else, waiting for Karpov to decide on
if he want to sealed his move  now. Some say that Kasparov might
have proposed a draw earlier on. Not verified. Time: 2:42 - 2:08.
Karpov sealed his 42nd move. The game will be continued (maybe)
tomorrow at 11:00 AM ET.

 \nochess And the 'soon-to-be' GM Will Watson from England is here too.
'I don't understand the GI' he just said. Kasparov stays on stage.
Time: White: 0:37 Black: 0:10. Says Will Watson (now WW): 'I
predicted the opening this morning. And so did many others.'
Valvo: 'I think this shows that the Kings Indian hasn't worked
out for Kasparov'. IM Levy suggests b7-b6 for Black. IM Jonathan Tisdall says:
I've seen this before. But nobody can find a game with it'. \endnochess \mn{11} d5 e*d5
\mn{12} e*d5 Re8
\mn{13} Be2 \nochess Time: White: 0:53 Black: 0:24. Valvo observed GK tapping his
fingers impatiently on the table after move Re8. It just might all
be preparations! Both are sitting deeply concentrated at the table. \endnochess  Bf5
\mn{14} O-O \nochess The atmosphere in the pressroom is a bit 'fuzzy'. The game hasn't
found it's own personality yet, and the fact that the US plays
the Soviets at the Chess Olympiad in Novi Sad at this very moment is
also widely discussed. \endnochess  Nd7
 \nochess Interesting is now: 15.Nh4 Be4 16.f3 Bxd5! 17.Qxd5 Rxe3 18.Qxd7
18...Rxe2 with a big Black plus. say Watson. Rumours say that
GK might be better here, but nobody really dares to risk his
neck. The game is still in its childhood. But AK surely is in for
a deep think. Now he's on 1:16 and still thinking. Garry has left the
stage. Valvo say: The Mephisto computer thinks Black is better!
It's no 'Deep Thought', but the Mephisto Chess Computer IS
already world champion in its class. No one else dared to test
their program against it! \endnochess \mn{15} h3 \nochess Time: White: 1:18 Black: 0:31. Now Karpov has left stage. And GK
hangs over the board as if to power up his chessmuscles. Kasparov seems
relaxed and satisfied. White's problem is his weakened pawns on the Q-side.
And as for his pride-pawn on d5? In an endgame it could be pure
gold, but until then it gives a good square to a Black piece
on d6. Kasparov now 'hangs' his head between his hands. A very typical
posture for the WC. \endnochess  Nb6
 \nochess GM Lein thinks White is in deep trouble. GK might play Nb6-a4.
Another of GK's ideas might be Qa5-a4. \endnochess \mn{16} g4 \nochess Now ...that's a man! Karpov's idea obviously is 16... Be4 17.c4 Qxd2
18.Nxd2 with 19.Nxe4 and 20.Bd3 to come. After a very slow start suddenly
the game is very exciting. Now the Russians GMs in the pressroom find:
16...Be4 17.c4.. Qa3! with a Black edge. But... \endnochess  Bd7
 \nochess Time: AK: 1:31  GK: 0:49. GM-elects Watson and Gallagher say Karpov is still
under pressure, but improving. Mephisto 'thinks' it's slightly better for
Black. And the Russians say that Kasparov should have played h7-h5, not
Nd7-b6. \endnochess \mn{17} c4 Q*d2
\mn{18} N*d2 Na4
\mn{19} Bf3 Nc3
\mn{20} R*c3 B*c3
\mn{21} Ne4 \nochess The heat is on, in the Palais des Congress. Watson thinks GK is still
doing well. Might be a British understatement. Kasparov is in for at deep
think. Time: White: 1:42 Black: 1:12 IM Tisdall: He'll take on e4 now,
and it is a draw. \endnochess  R*e4
\mn{22} B*e4 Re8
\mn{23} Bd3 b6
\mn{24} Kg2 \nochess Tisdall says: The first one who can bring himself to offer a draw
will get it. He might be right. A drastic change of the game has
taken place. And where did Kasparov drop his advantage? Maybe ...Nc3
should have been prepared. Time: White: 1:46 Black: 1:17.
If Karpov plays Be3-c1 to press f2-f4 (hoping for an endgame
advantage with f4-f5) GK might play Re8-e1 to enter a tame
dobble-bishop ending. Draw. \endnochess  f5
\mn{25} g*f5 B*f5

GAME 13 - Drawn after Adjournment
November 24, 1990 \endnochess  \nochess KARPOV  KASPAROV \endnochess \mn{1} d4 Nf6
\mn{2} c4 g6
\mn{3} Nc3 d5
 \nochess Welcome to game 13th ..and the GI that's Grunfeld-Indian. Fight
from the start. \endnochess \mn{4} c*d5 N*d5
\mn{5} e4 N*c3
\mn{6} b*c3 Bg7
\mn{7} Be3 c5
\mn{8} Qd2 O-O
 \nochess So far on two minutes each. GK.. Garry Kasparov looks tensed, says
Mike Valvo. Now Karpov took full 9 minutes to play ... \endnochess \mn{9} Rc1 Qa5
 \nochess Kasparov thought six minutes here. Time now: White 0:19 Black: 0:08.
Now 9 minutes has gone and AK is still thinks. Kasparov has left
the stage. Who is fooling who? 9..Qa5 might be a new move. Its
not in the pressroom database. Karpov is still thinking, so time for a
little presentation. At your service in Lyon IM Bjarke Kristensen (Now Valvo:
AK is nodding his head up and down alone on stage.) As kommentators:
Boris Spassky and a number of strong french IM's. IM Mike Valvo from New Jersey
is here for a week. \endnochess \mn{10} Nf3 e6
 \nochess And the 'soon-to-be' GM Will Watson from England is here too.
'I don't understand the GI' he just said. Kasparov stays on stage.
Time: White: 0:37 Black: 0:10. Says Will Watson (now WW): 'I
predicted the opening this morning. And so did many others.'
Valvo: 'I think this shows that the Kings Indian hasn't worked
out for Kasparov'. IM Levy suggests b7-b6 for Black. IM Jonathan Tisdall says:
I've seen this before. But nobody can find a game with it'. \endnochess \mn{11} d5 e*d5
\mn{12} e*d5 Re8
\mn{13} Be2 \nochess Time: White: 0:53 Black: 0:24. Valvo observed GK tapping his
fingers impatiently on the table after move Re8. It just might all
be preparations! Both are sitting deeply concentrated at the table. \endnochess  Bf5
\mn{14} O-O \nochess The atmosphere in the pressroom is a bit 'fuzzy'. The game hasn't
found it's own personality yet, and the fact that the US plays
the Soviets at the Chess Olympiad in Novi Sad at this very moment is
also widely discussed. \endnochess  Nd7
 \nochess Interesting is now: 15.Nh4 Be4 16.f3 Bxd5! 17.Qxd5 Rxe3 18.Qxd7
18...Rxe2 with a big Black plus. say Watson. Rumours say that
GK might be better here, but nobody really dares to risk his
neck. The game is still in its childhood. But AK surely is in for
a deep think. Now he's on 1:16 and still thinking. Garry has left the
stage. Valvo say: The Mephisto computer thinks Black is better!
It's no 'Deep Thought', but the Mephisto Chess Computer IS
already world champion in its class. No one else dared to test
their program against it! \endnochess \mn{15} h3 \nochess Time: White: 1:18 Black: 0:31. Now Karpov has left stage. And GK
hangs over the board as if to power up his chessmuscles. Kasparov seems
relaxed and satisfied. White's problem is his weakened pawns on the Q-side.
And as for his pride-pawn on d5? In an endgame it could be pure
gold, but until then it gives a good square to a Black piece
on d6. Kasparov now 'hangs' his head between his hands. A very typical
posture for the WC. \endnochess  Nb6
 \nochess GM Lein thinks White is in deep trouble. GK might play Nb6-a4.
Another of GK's ideas might be Qa5-a4. \endnochess \mn{16} g4 \nochess Now ...that's a man! Karpov's idea obviously is 16... Be4 17.c4 Qxd2
18.Nxd2 with 19.Nxe4 and 20.Bd3 to come. After a very slow start suddenly
the game is very exciting. Now the Russians GMs in the pressroom find:
16...Be4 17.c4.. Qa3! with a Black edge. But... \endnochess  Bd7
 \nochess Time: AK: 1:31  GK: 0:49. GM-elects Watson and Gallagher say Karpov is still
under pressure, but improving. Mephisto 'thinks' it's slightly better for
Black. And the Russians say that Kasparov should have played h7-h5, not
Nd7-b6. \endnochess \mn{17} c4 Q*d2
\mn{18} N*d2 Na4
\mn{19} Bf3 Nc3
\mn{20} R*c3 B*c3
\mn{21} Ne4 \nochess The heat is on, in the Palais des Congress. Watson thinks GK is still
doing well. Might be a British understatement. Kasparov is in for at deep
think. Time: White: 1:42 Black: 1:12 IM Tisdall: He'll take on e4 now,
and it is a draw. \endnochess  R*e4
\mn{22} B*e4 Re8
\mn{23} Bd3 b6
\mn{24} Kg2 \nochess Tisdall says: The first one who can bring himself to offer a draw
will get it. He might be right. A drastic change of the game has
taken place. And where did Kasparov drop his advantage? Maybe ...Nc3
should have been prepared. Time: White: 1:46 Black: 1:17.
If Karpov plays Be3-c1 to press f2-f4 (hoping for an endgame
advantage with f4-f5) GK might play Re8-e1 to enter a tame
dobble-bishop ending. Draw. \endnochess  f5
\mn{25} g*f5 B*f5
\mn{26} B*f5 g*f5
 \nochess Karpov sits thinking alone at the board. Black's Bc3 is potentially weaker
than Be3, but White's c4 pawn is GK's major target. I think that Black's
still better. White's d-pawn looks strong (and it is) but right now it's
quite impotent. If advanced it'll just be lost, since Kg8 is to close. \endnochess \mn{27} Rd1 Kf7
 \nochess Time: White: 2:07 Black: 1:28. Now Kasparov's lead on the clock
begins to count. Karpov must be considering lines like: 28.d6 Ke6 29.Bf4
Be5 30.Bxe5 Kxe5 31.Rd5+ Ke6 32.d7 Rd8 and Black is much better. \endnochess \mn{28} Rd3 Bf6
\mn{29} Ra3 a5
\mn{30} Rb3 \nochess Time: White: 2:12 Black: 1:31. It might look simple, but in fact

GAME 13 - Drawn after Adjournment
November 24, 1990  KARPOV  KASPAROV  Welcome to game 13th ..and the GI that's Grunfeld-Indian. Fight
from the start.  So far on two minutes each. GK.. Garry Kasparov looks tensed, says
Mike Valvo. Now Karpov took full 9 minutes to play ...  Kasparov thought six minutes here. Time now: White 0:19 Black: 0:08.
Now 9 minutes has gone and AK is still thinks. Kasparov has left
the stage. Who is fooling who? 9..Qa5 might be a new move. Its
not in the pressroom database. Karpov is still thinking, so time for a
little presentation. At your service in Lyon IM Bjarke Kristensen (Now Valvo:
AK is nodding his head up and down alone on stage.) As kommentators:
Boris Spassky and a number of strong french IM's. IM Mike Valvo from New Jersey
is here for a week.  And the 'soon-to-be' GM Will Watson from England is here too.
'I don't understand the GI' he just said. Kasparov stays on stage.
Time: White: 0:37 Black: 0:10. Says Will Watson (now WW): 'I
predicted the opening this morning. And so did many others.'
Valvo: 'I think this shows that the Kings Indian hasn't worked
out for Kasparov'. IM Levy suggests b7-b6 for Black. IM Jonathan Tisdall says:
I've seen this before. But nobody can find a game with it'.  Time: White: 0:53 Black: 0:24. Valvo observed GK tapping his
fingers impatiently on the table after move Re8. It just might all
be preparations! Both are sitting deeply concentrated at the table.  The atmosphere in the pressroom is a bit 'fuzzy'. The game hasn't
found it's own personality yet, and the fact that the US plays
the Soviets at the Chess Olympiad in Novi Sad at this very moment is
also widely discussed.  Interesting is now: 15.Nh4 Be4 16.f3 Bxd5! 17.Qxd5 Rxe3 18.Qxd7
18...Rxe2 with a big Black plus. say Watson. Rumours say that
GK might be better here, but nobody really dares to risk his
neck. The game is still in its childhood. But AK surely is in for
a deep think. Now he's on 1:16 and still thinking. Garry has left the
stage. Valvo say: The Mephisto computer thinks Black is better!
It's no 'Deep Thought', but the Mephisto Chess Computer IS
already world champion in its class. No one else dared to test
their program against it!  Time: White: 1:18 Black: 0:31. Now Karpov has left stage. And GK
hangs over the board as if to power up his chessmuscles. Kasparov seems
relaxed and satisfied. White's problem is his weakened pawns on the Q-side.
And as for his pride-pawn on d5? In an endgame it could be pure
gold, but until then it gives a good square to a Black piece
on d6. Kasparov now 'hangs' his head between his hands. A very typical
posture for the WC.  GM Lein thinks White is in deep trouble. GK might play Nb6-a4.
Another of GK's ideas might be Qa5-a4.  Now ...that's a man! Karpov's idea obviously is 16... Be4 17.c4 Qxd2
18.Nxd2 with 19.Nxe4 and 20.Bd3 to come. After a very slow start suddenly
the game is very exciting. Now the Russians GMs in the pressroom find:
16...Be4 17.c4.. Qa3! with a Black edge. But...  Time: AK: 1:31  GK: 0:49. GM-elects Watson and Gallagher say Karpov is still
under pressure, but improving. Mephisto 'thinks' it's slightly better for
Black. And the Russians say that Kasparov should have played h7-h5, not
Nd7-b6.  The heat is on, in the Palais des Congress. Watson thinks GK is still
doing well. Might be a British understatement. Kasparov is in for at deep
think. Time: White: 1:42 Black: 1:12 IM Tisdall: He'll take on e4 now,
and it is a draw.  Tisdall says: The first one who can bring himself to offer a draw
will get it. He might be right. A drastic change of the game has
taken place. And where did Kasparov drop his advantage? Maybe ...Nc3
should have been prepared. Time: White: 1:46 Black: 1:17.
If Karpov plays Be3-c1 to press f2-f4 (hoping for an endgame
advantage with f4-f5) GK might play Re8-e1 to enter a tame
dobble-bishop ending. Draw.  Karpov sits thinking alone at the board. Black's Bc3 is potentially weaker
than Be3, but White's c4 pawn is GK's major target. I think that Black's
still better. White's d-pawn looks strong (and it is) but right now it's
quite impotent. If advanced it'll just be lost, since Kg8 is to close.  Time: White: 2:07 Black: 1:28. Now Kasparov's lead on the clock
begins to count. Karpov must be considering lines like: 28.d6 Ke6 29.Bf4
Be5 30.Bxe5 Kxe5 31.Rd5+ Ke6 32.d7 Rd8 and Black is much better.  Time: White: 2:12 Black: 1:31. It might look simple, but in fact
the game is balanced on an edge. Which is most important: Black's
weakness on b6 or White's on c4?  People in the pressroom seems to be losing interest a bit. I think
that a long endgame battle may be ahead. The fight for the
initiative is still very much on. Now Watson arrived with news,..
he said: The Russians think GK is slightly better, the Americans
thinks AK is slightly better and it might be a draw' says Watson.  Both are leaning across the board. If Karpov can get his king to d3,
he might play on forever. Kasparov seems 'speculative' now.
One point in Karpov's favour is: 31...Bc7 32.Kf3 Re4 33.Ke2 f4
34.Kd3 and Re4 has to move.  Karpov is hiding his head behind his hands, looking through his
fingers. Nine minutes left.  33...f4! GK played this with determination. I don't understand
Karpov's Kg2-f1.  Kasparov has moved from c8 to c4. Move 41 made. The last seven
moves took only 11 minutes Now all analysis goes: 42.Kxd3
Rxa4 43.d6 Ra3+ 44.Kc4 Ra1 45. Kd5 Rd1+ 46.Kc6 a4 and White
might be the one who in trouble. Both still sits at the board. GK
is looking everywhere else, waiting for Karpov to decide on
if he want to sealed his move  now. Some say that Kasparov might
have proposed a draw earlier on. Not verified. Time: 2:42 - 2:08.
Karpov sealed his 42nd move. The game will be continued (maybe)
tomorrow at 11:00 AM ET.
